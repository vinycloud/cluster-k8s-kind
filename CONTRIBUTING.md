# Contributing

* Install the following packages: ``git`` and a text editor of your choice. By default, the use of **VSCode is recommended**.
* Configure authentication on your Github account to use the SSH protocol instead of HTTP. Watch this tutorial to learn how to set up: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
* Create a fork this repository.
* Clone the forked repository to your local system.
* Add a Git remote for the original repository.

```bash
git remote -v
git remote add upstream git@github.com:rafaelperoco/kind.git
git remote -v
```

* Create a branch using the pattern: `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`. Example: *git checkout -b mybranch*
* Make your changes to the new branch.
* Test your changes in *development* environment.
* Commit the changes to the branch.
* Push files to repository remote with command `git push --set-upstream origin BRANCH_NAME`. Example: *git push --set-upstream origin mybranch*
* Create Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch. See this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
* Update the content with the suggestions of the reviewer (if necessary).
* After your pull request is merged, update your local clone.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

* Clean up after your pull request is merged with command `git branch -d <branch name>`. Example: *git branch -d mybranch*
* Then you can update the ``main`` branch in your forked repository.

```bash
git push origin main
```

* And push the deletion of the feature branch to your GitHub repository with command `git push --delete origin <branch name>`. Example: *git push --delete origin mybranch*
* To keep your fork in sync with the original repository, use these commands:

```bash
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```
